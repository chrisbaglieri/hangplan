## Philadelphia Startup Weekend 2012

Hangplan was the idea pitched by (my now dear friend) [Melissa](https://twitter.com/operationnice) at Philadelphia Startup Weekend 2012; it subsequently went on to win second place. The gist of what we set out to build was a simple, fun way to plan get togethers with friends and discover what they're doing this week. Our motto was "there's always something fun to do."

Hangplan was born out of frustrations of trying to organize get togethers over email and Facebook. Hangplan flipped the traditional model of broadcasting invites and instead broadcasted the event itself. Friends interested in joining "opted in", not dissimilar to how Fouresquare's Swarm works today. Our philosophy that weekend, two words, have fun. That's it, simple and to the point. We came to have a good time and spend 54 hours doing what we love to do. We succeeded.
